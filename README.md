# Urban Lifestyle & Health Impact Survey 
### A Multivariate Behavioral Analysis of Metro City Residents

## Project Overview
This project explores how different lifestyle factors such as screen time, sleep, junk food intake, and stress impact the health of people living in metro cities. We used both Python and Power BI to clean data, perform statistical analysis, and visualize key insights.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas,Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, StatsModels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- MS Word (for documentation)
- GitHub

##  Key Highlights
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Univariate & Bivariate Analysis  
- Outlier Detection (Z-Score, IQR)  
- Feature Engineering (Binning, Flags)  
- Statistical Tests (T-Test, ANOVA, Chi-Square)  
- Logistic Regression & CLT Simulation  
- Power BI Dashboard Reporting

##  Power BI Dashboard
We designed two pages in Power BI:

1. **Page 1:** KPI Cards, Gender-wise Trends, Sleep & Screen Time Comparison  
2. **Page 2:** Advanced visuals like stacked bars, distributions, stress vs activity, etc.

## ⚠️ Note
The dataset used was partly simulated and may not fully represent real-world conditions. Hence, the focus was on demonstrating analytical and statistical skills.

##  Future Scope
- Collecting real-time or government health survey data
- Adding machine learning prediction models
- Creating interactive dashboards with map & time-based filters
